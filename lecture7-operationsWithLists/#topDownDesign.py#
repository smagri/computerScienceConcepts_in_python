#weather.cvs
#date, highTemp, lowTemp, rainfall

# weather.csv date, high temperature on that date, the low temperature
# on that date,  and the rainfall on that date.


# This type of  file is called a comma-separated value  (CSV) file, or
# sometimes a comma-delimited file. For  data that starts out in Excel
# or another  spreadsheet program,  itâ€™s easy  to use  the spreadsheet
# program to  output the data  values, separated  by commas, as  a CSV
# file.

# HOWTO GET CVS FILE from CUT and PAST
# To get  weather data  like this, you  can go to  any one  of several
# weather  sites, some  of  which  will let  you  download  it into  a
# spreadsheet, but you can ALSO CUT  AND PASTE DATA INTO A SPREADSHEET
# then you can save it in as a CVS file yourself.
