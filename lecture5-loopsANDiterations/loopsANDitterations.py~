# A while loop is  used when we’re not sure how  many times we’ll need
# to iterate  through the  loop; a  for loop  is used  when we  have a
# precise set of things to loop through,

# FOR loop:  where we increment some  value by one on  every iteration
# (meaning one time through a loop),

# We start with the word “for.”  We then give the iterator variable we
# want to use, which  is i in this case. Then, we  have the word “in.”
# And then we have the range, followed by a colon.

# range STATEMENT:
# ---------------

# * specifies starting index of 0, max index within range parentheses,
#   itteration increment is 1.

# * If  there are  two values  in the  parentheses we  increment by  1
#   starting from the first value and not exceeding the second.

# * If there are three numbers, start index, limit index and increment
# * amount.  If the increment amount is -ve you countdown.
