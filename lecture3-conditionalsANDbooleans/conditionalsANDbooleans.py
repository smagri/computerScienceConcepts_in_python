# We start  the statement with the  word “if,” and this  tells us that
# we’ll be  having a  condition.  Right  after the  “if,” we  have the
# condition itself. The  condition is something that’s  either true or
# false.  This  is an example  of if statment  using a boolian  as the
# condition instead of an expression, just  for interest I have put it
# here.   The boolian  'True' needs  to  be capitalised  to signify  a
# constant in  python, otherwise it  treats it  as a variable.   It is
# common to make a constant capitalised in python.

# Note: 4 SPACES OR NON-STANDARD TAB is required FOR the IF STATEMENT
# BLOCK.  Some editors will convert tabs to 4 spaces anyhow, emacs
# pyrhon mode appears to do this.  INTENTS are SIGNIFICANT to COMPILER
# in PYTHON!!!

# When  we  have an  else  statement  immediately  followed by  an  if
# statement,  we can  use  an  elif—which is  short  for “else  if”—to
# combine them together without having  to indent further. Anytime you
# have an else-if  combination, it’s probably much  clearer to combine
# these  statements with  the elif.  yas-describe-tables: use  ife and
# eliTAB to construct.

 # comparison conditionals are as per c/c++: ie =assignment >, >=,
 # ==equality, !=inequality...etc
