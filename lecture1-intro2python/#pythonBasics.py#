# Also,  Python as  an interpreted  language 12:53min,  is interesting
# though.  Python is an interpreted language  as you can go through it
# line by line and understand what  it is doing, hence python programs
# are  also called  scripts.  Thus  python can  be called  a scripting
# language, that is an interprative  language that gives you access to
# some high level  commands.  To use it as an  iterprative language on
# linux, type 'python'  on the command line and  execute the following
# code(exercises) without  using the  print statement and  without the
# print statement.

# Exercises:
print("Exercises: see comments on why they call python  an interpreted\n"
      "language.  In linux just type 'python' on the command line to see.")
print(1+2+3+4+5)
print("1+2+3+4+5")
print(3**2 + 4**2)
print(3*(5+2))
#print(100)
print(1/2 + 1/2)

# remember a fraction is represented as: quotient/remainder
print (1//2 + 1//2) # quotient returned and ignore remainder
print(10/3)
print(10/4)

print(3985780149 % 2) # remainder retusimn; % is also called the modulus
                      # operator
print(10%3)
print(9%2)
print(13%7)
print(16%6)


# @18min, python allows differenct  styles of programming, procedural,
# like c and fortran, and object oriented like c++.  The course starts
# with  procedural programming  and does  oo  in the  last third.   It
# supports functional  programming also but  it's not covered  in this
# course. You can combine the styles in the one program.

# @19min In python INDENTATION MATTERS.


# 25min Gettig user  input, REMEBER this is using  python3, won't work
# in python2.   Make sure you MAKE  THIS SCRIPT A PYTHON3  one or this
# wont  work. On  ubuntu  18.04  the default  'python'  command has  a
# simlink  to  the  latest  version of  python2.   Making  the  script
# 'python3' on the  first line will get the linux  symlink to point to
# the latest python3 on the system.

name = input ("enter your name: ")
print("hello", name)
